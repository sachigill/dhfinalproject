## US Traffic Accident Project Overview
Traffic accidents are some of the most widely occurring events that happen everywhere across the globe. They take place every single day, and can happen at any time. Traffic accidents have huge impacts on our population as they can lead to injuries, death, as well as economic loss.
However, for the most part because these events are just a normal daily occurrence, people donâ€™t pay too much attention. Only something like a plane crash may get thorough coverage and analysis. When traffic accidents occur, there usually is not much coverage or in depth research on factors that may play a role, or the detection of any patterns and common themes in regards to traffic accidents. Understanding what factors could potentially contribute to traffic accidents can hopefully help to improve traffic safety and create effective preventative policies or plans. My project delves into a comprehensive U.S. traffic accident dataset, revealing insights about accidents, severity, and contributing factors across different locations and time periods. By comparing this data over time and relative to different conditions, I aim to reveal patterns or correlations in the data, to hopefully understand the trends and underlying causes of traffic accidents.

My main focus for this projects can be seen through my primary research questions: 

1) What is the relationship between weather, location, or time of day on severity or number of accidents? Are there any common themes?

2) How have traffic accidents changed over time, and did events such as Covid-19 have any effect on traffic accidents or severity?
